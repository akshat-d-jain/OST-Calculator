# Simple Java Calculator.

This is a simple console-based calculator written in Java. The calculator allows users to do basic mathematical operations such as calculating variance, standard deviation, and mean given a set of numbers.


## Usage

1. **execute the Program:** - Compile and execute the 'Main.java' file with a Java compiler.

2. Follow the on-screen instructions:
   - Enter the first and second digits as requested.
   - Select an operation.
      - Add (+) - Subtract (-)
      - Multiplication (*).
      - Division (/).
      - Array operation (A).

3. **For array operations:**
   - Enter the array's size.
   - Enter the elements of the array.
   - Select an array operation.
      - Variance (var).
      - Standard Deviation (SD)
      - Mean (Average)

## Example:

'''Bash Enter First Number: 5 Enter Second Number: 3
To enter operations, use + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division, and A for arrays.
